Welcome to scikit-build
=======================

**scikit-build** is an improved build system generator for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython
extensions. It provides better support for additional compilers, build
systems, cross compilation, and locating dependencies and their associated
build requirements.

The **scikit-build** package is fundamentally just glue between
the ``setuptools`` Python module and `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_.

To get started, see :ref:`this example <basic_usage_example>`.
For more examples, see `scikit-build-sample-projects <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects>`_.
